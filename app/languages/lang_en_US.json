Volunteers (<em><q>show noter</q></em>) listen to shows together and write notes, collect links or search for further information.",
	"FAQ_SHOW_NOTES_ANSWER": "Show notes are <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadaten\">meta data</a> for podcasts. They don't contain the podcast itself but all descriptive information which is generally tagged with a time stamp. Thereby the content of a pure audio file becomes searchable.",
	"FAQ_OSF_ANSWER": "<q>OSF</q> stands for <em><q>Open Shownotes Format</q></em>. This format defined by us standardizes the creation of show notes. For example, this is a typical line of OSF:<br /><code>00:13:37 Geofencing &lt;https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geofencing&gt; #g</code><br />From left to right: <em>time stamp</em>, <em>text</em>, <em>link</em>, <em>tag</em>.
